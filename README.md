## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to rely on background images and tailwind media breakpoints to set a background at different screen sizes without overcomplicating things trying to track the screen size with JS.
Used JS for the first time in a Frontend Mentor project to do a simple form validation.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to start using JS more heavily, keep improving my CSS and Tailwind skills and learn more about Next.js.
